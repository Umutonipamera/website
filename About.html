                        Even if it was not easy for her but she tried to save some money and sometimes she used to
                        sacrifice manythings for the sake of saving because she wanted to pay university for herself.
                        After some months saving she started her university in <b>Marketing departnment</b>, it was a
                        great achievement in her life because it was one of her dream, being able to pay for
                        herself without depending on someone else,but in life there is a thing that many people go
                        through, so even her as a person she met with a challenge which is "Civid 19". When covid 19
                        came everything in her life changed . she lost her job as a result of covid 19 and offcourse
                        she stopped her studies because she couldn't continue to study when she was not working yet she
                        was the one who pay for herself.
                        Anyways everything come for a reason. After some months without working and studying she heard
                        about a program that give opportunites to young women in East Africa countries, it is a one year
                        program that provides tech skills to young women with full scholarship to help them to prepare

                        be admitted,one month later she recieved a call that informed her that she has been admitted.Now
                        she is a student at AkiraChix and she believes in her self that she will become the person that
                        she always dream about to become in  herlife.
