                <h2 id="blg">  Patricia and Abel's marriage</h2><br>
                <p>
                    "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever
                    married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he
                    wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for
                    that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be
                    subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women.
                    “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream
                    is to put her in a cage." Abel wanted a traditional woman because in his culture "Tsonga culture"
                        was
                        extremely patriachad where women from his culture must bow when they great a man and men and
                        women have
                        limited social interaction in that men where the one who used to work for the house and women
                        assigned
                        to stay home with kids,cooking food and take care of all work of the house but finally Abel
                        didn't marry
                        a traditional woman due to he fallen in love with Patricia and end up got married with her even
                        if she
                        was not a kind of traditional woman , the only reason behind their marriage was that they loved
                        eachother.</p>

                <h2 id="blg">Trevor Noah's Humors</h2><br>
                <p>
                    Trevor was born in apartheid South Africa. As if that wasn’t hard enough, his very existence was a
                    crime
                    because he was the child of a white father and a black mother.Trevor Noah’s funny and heartfelt
                    stories
                    of a his life in a dangerous time only equipped with humor.This helped him to communicate with
                    different
                    people and sometimes he used humor in a kind jokes and many people found thier selves connected with
                    him
                    because only the way he used to use humor ,it was some kind funny even when what he wanted to say
                    was
                    not funny for example when he were with his mother and father in the park and when his father was
                    walking away from them and he ran after him,screaming,"Daddy!Daddy!Daddy!" people started looking
                    and
                    his daddy panicked and ran away but Trevor thought that it was a game and he kept chasing him and I
                    remember the way he used humor to argue whether with his mother or grand mother when they warn him
                    from
                    doing any thing. example when his grand mother told him not to leave the house but he insisted buy
                    telling her that "Please.Please, can I go play with my cousins?".And using humor helped him when the
                    two guys wanted to mug him but when he heard what they were saying he just said <b></b>"Yo, guys,
                    why don't we just mug someone together? I'm ready. let's do it."</b> this made those guys shocked
                    and then started laughing and their goal of mugging him stopped.
