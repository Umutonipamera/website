                        sacrifice many things for the sake of saving because she wanted to pay university for herself.
                        After some months saving she started her university in <b>Marketing departnment</b>, it was a
                        great achievement in her life because it was one of her dream, being able to pay for

                        be admitted, her dreams became true she has been admitted.Now
